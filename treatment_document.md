# Treatment Document – GROUP Sunday, March 19th
Submit PDF file (only!) by due the date through Discord. 

## Game Design Constraints
The following are required constraints on your game design and implementation. The reasons
for these constraints are pedagogical, but almost all game projects have some significant constraints,
whether they come from technical, financial, legal or market (or pedagogical) sources. Note that when
constraints below say "at least", that means you may exceed the requirement, but we strongly
recommend against it, since it is better to do a more polished job with limited scope than to only partially accomplish overly ambitious goals.

Notice that the setting, narrative, character personality and game mechanic aspects of your project are
not constrained. 

The game design must include:
- A solid gameplay mechanic which makes your game enjoyable and fun to play set in a 3D environment using 3D assets. Note, this does not mean that the camera cannot be locked to a single angle. 2D gameplay mechanics are thus allowed, but should use 3D assets.
- 1 fully-animated, bipedal, main character. This character can be used as either a player avatar (third person game) or a featured non-player character (NPC).
- At least 4 secondary animated non-player characters or interactive objects that the main character interacts with.
- A single environment/level with at least 20 static level objects (buildings, foliage, etc.).
- At least 25 unique triggerable sound effects.

The following are additional art-specific requirements for each IMGD 4500 student, which are included
here for the shared knowledge of the entire team:

- The main character shall be modeled, optimized, textured (diffuse, metalness and glossiness, normal map), rigged, and animated with at least the following animations: walk, run, idle, jump, and two additional game-specific actions.
- The secondary characters and interactive objects shall be modeled, optimized, textured (diffuse, metalness and glossiness, normal map), rigged and animated with at least 2 unique animations.
- The game environment, with texture and lighting, shall contain at least 20 static objects, all of which must have full texture sets (diffuse, metalness and glossiness, normal map).
- At least 25 unique sound effects (all triggerable/interactive).
- 1 ambient stage sound track.
- At least 5 particle effects (associated with specific gameplay actions or ambient)
- The majority of your game should consist of assets that you’ve created yourself – however, the use of complimentary assets (models, textures, shaders, sounds, etc.) is allowed. Provided that your own content still outweighs these additional assets.

## Treatment Document
Note, the treatment is not a contract, but rather a chance for the team to think through most aspects of
the game before starting. You may, and likely will, change your mind about details as you work on the
project - that is fine.

Keep a copy of this document and add it to your game website, as soon as it is created (see the timeline
for when the website needs to be up).
The elevator pitch below should be a maximum of three sentences, e.g., "A top-down shooter using rotten vegetables that takes place in the supermarket produce section. You win the game by hitting your
opponent with a complete salad."

Treatment Information/Sections include:
- Game Title
- Team Leader (include email)
- IMGD 4000 Students (including emails)
- IMGD 4500 Students (including email)
- Elevator Pitch (maximum 3 sentences describing the game)
- Detailed Description

The detailed description should include:
- Where and when does the game take place?
- Who/what are the protagonist and adversary (which one is the player)?
- Explain the primary objective of the player and how the player wins.
- Explain the general game narrative (if any) in 1-2 paragraphs
- What is the basic game mechanic? (Use visuals, as appropriate)
- Include asset list (with brief description, as needed). Your asset list should list everything you anticipate having to create for the game from both a tech and art standpoint.
- Briefly describe the technical requirements that will be used in the game (e.g., physics, pathfinding, networking, AI).
- Include style guide, with all sketches, images, and concept art. artists will need to have come up with one concept sketch for their main character, 5 NPC characters/objects, and environment.

The faculty will provide feedback in the first lab after the treatment due date regarding the proposed art
and tech scope, and may suggest changes.

Art students specific note: Though this is not required to be submitted with the Treatment Document, you should be starting your greybox environment in this week. So manage your time well and get sketches/concept art out of the way early.
