# IMGD 4000 A* assignment
One single goal for this assignment.

1. Implement the [A* algorithm](https://www.redblobgames.com/pathfinding/a-star/introduction.html), the most commonly found pathfinding algorithm in gaming and the basis for Unrealâ€™s pathfinding engine (not counting EQS).

## Requirements
1. Implement A* in C++ or Blueprints, by subclassing the AIController class. Your level map should feature a variety of different types of terrain (these can just be different colored blocks) with different weights attached to them, walls, and a goal for your AI to travel to.
2. Create a video showing your AI traversing the level.
3. Post your repo to GitHub. Include a README that links to your gameplay video and provides a brief description of the project.
4. DM me the repo link in the course Slack workspace by May 13th. 

## Grading
80% : is A* implemented correctly   
20% : correctly followed instructions (posted video, made GitHub repo etc.)
