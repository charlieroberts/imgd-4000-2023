# IMGD4000: Agent-based simulation assignment
One goal for this assignment, to implement the [Boids algorithm](http://www.kfish.org/boids/pseudocode.html), originally presented [in a classic paper that has been cited over 11000 times](https://www.google.com/url?sa=t&rct=j&q=&esrc=s&source=web&cd=3&cad=rja&uact=8&ved=2ahUKEwiqy5OP_tPoAhWDuJ4KHdqmDH4QFjACegQIIhAB&url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.cs.toronto.edu%2F~dt%2Fsiggraph97-course%2Fcwr87%2F&usg=AOvVaw2StOMrXs0E_nHLgD87UrGN).

[Hereâ€™s a video of the original simulation in action](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=86iQiV3-3IA). 
For an in-depth treatment of agent-based steering algorithms more generally (including Boids) 
try [this chapter from the Nature of Code](https://natureofcode.com/book/chapter-6-autonomous-agents/). 
The author of this chapter also walks through implementing the algorithm (in 2D) 
in [his amazing Coding Train series](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mhjuuHl6qHM). 
But the first link in this assignment is perhaps the easiest to follow, with clear pseudocode and explanations of the algorithm. 

## Requirements
1. Implement Boids in C++. 
2. Create a gameplay video and post it.
4. Post your repo to GitHub. Include a README that describes your game and links to your gameplay video.
5. DM me the repo link in Slack by the last day of class.

## Grading
60% : Are the three basic rules of boids implemented correctly (20% for each rule)
20% : implement one of the tweaks (your choice) described at the [algorithm overview](http://www.kfish.org/boids/pseudocode.html
20% : correctly followed instructions (posted video, made GitHub repo etc.)
